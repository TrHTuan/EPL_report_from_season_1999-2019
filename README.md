# EPL_report_from_season_1999-2019
This repository is to show my approach to getting a report that I want using Python and MySQL.

The first half of my process focuses on using Python to clean up and transform the obtained data, as well as transfering the desirable tables to MySQL server.
The second hald of my process focuses on using MySQL to write a query to generate a report table to show the result of EPL (particularly league) from season 1999 - season 2020.

For more information regarding the data source, refer to this website: https://github.com/footballcsv/england.
Credits to the owner of this repository for the availability and update of the data source.
